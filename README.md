- Hi, my name is Ran, and I'm currently a M.S. in Applied Data Science student with strong Computer Science background!
- My GPA is 4.0/4.0. 
- I can ...

# Do some Machine Learning and even Deep Learning!
- I've finished the course DSCI 552: Machine Learning for Data Science, and in that course, 
  - I did some Machine Learning Projects, for example:
    - Used Linear Regression to predict the used car price
    - Used Logistic Regression to classify if a certain treatment is recommended for the patient or not
    - Used K-means to determine which type a patient belongs to
  - And some Deep Learning Projects:
    - Computer Vision: Built an image classifier that can sort chest CT scans into three categories
    - Natural Language Processing: Built a RNN model to do Emotion Classification
    - Time Series Analysis: Built a RNN Model to predict temperatures based on historical records

# Design and interact with APIs 
- I'm currently taking CSCI 571: Web Technologies, and by far,
  - I've finished building a simple API using flask
    - That takes in the age and weight of a person, and predict his/her blood pressure using Linear Regression

    - Feel free to play with it: https://taoran.pythonanywhere.com
  - And a MUCH MORE COMPLEX ONE!!!
    - That allow administrators to login in the system
    - Upload a chest scan into the system (and the system will store it in a cloud database: Firebase)
    - Get the image classfication result, upload the result into the system (and, of course, our cloud database)

    - And get all the data from cloud database
