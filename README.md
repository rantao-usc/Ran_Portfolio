# Do some Machine Learning and even Deep Learning!
- I've finished the course DSCI 552: Machine Learning for Data Science, and in that course, 
  - I did some Machine Learning Projects, for example:
    - Used Linear Regression to predict the used car price
    - Used Logistic Regression to classify if a certain treatment is recommended for the patient or not
    - Used K-means to determine which type a patient belongs to
  - And some Deep Learning Projects:
    - Computer Vision: Built an image classifier that can sort chest X-ray data into three categories
    - Natural Language Processing: Built a RNN model to do Emotion Classification
    - Time Series Analysis: Built a RNN Model to predict temperatures based on historical records
