- Hi, my name is Ran, and I'm currently a M.S. in Applied Data Science student with strong Computer Science background!
- My GPA is 4.0/4.0. 
- I can ...

# Do some Machine Learning and even Deep Learning!
- I've finished the course DSCI 552: Machine Learning for Data Science, and in that course 
  - I did some **Machine Learning** Projects, for example:
    - Linear Regression: Predict used car price
    - Logistic Regression: Classify if a certain treatment is recommended for the patient
    - K-means: Determine which type a patient belongs to
  - And some **Deep Learning** Projects:
    - Computer Vision: Built an image classifier that can sort chest CT scans into three categories
    - Natural Language Processing: Built a RNN model to do Emotion Classification
    - Time Series Analysis: Built a RNN Model to predict temperatures based on historical records

# Design and interact with APIs 
- I'm currently taking CSCI 571: Web Technologies, and by far,
  - I've finished building a simple API using flask
    - This takes in the age and weight of a person, and predicts his/her blood pressure using Linear Regression

    - Feel free to play with it: [https://taoran.pythonanywhere.com](https://taoran.pythonanywhere.com)
  - And a MUCH MORE COMPLEX ONE!!!
    - This allows administrators to login in the system
    - Upload a chest scan into a cloud database: Firebase
    - Get the image classfication result, and upload the result

    - And get all the data from cloud database

# Something in the end...
- My GPA is **4.0/4.0**, which indicates I'm **a rapid learner**
- I've completed many foudation courses in 
  - **Math** (Advanced Mathematics, Linear Algebra, Probability Theory and Mathematical Statistics, Discrete Mathematics, Operational Research)
  - and **Computer Science** (JAVA Programming, Computer Network, Data Structure and Algorithm)
  - which indeed gives me a **solid foundation** to learn new things quick
- And more importantly, I get a **minor in Management** in my undergraduate, which means I took most foundation courses in **business** field
  - This gives me strong **business acumen** to understand business problems quickly and correctly
  - which I think is really important in becoming a research assistant in business school
- I hope you will consider my resume favorably and consider me for the position. I look forward to hearing from you!!!
